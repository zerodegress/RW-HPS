# RW-HPS Project
RW-HPS is a Rusted Warfare game server, used to quickly set up high-performance game servers on servers running Java8

## Features
### High performance
Ditch the <Java -Blocking IO / BIO> development approach used by the game itself and use <Java -Not-Blocking IO / NIO> to increase throughput and reduce latency
### Plugin framework
Despite most of the things you can do in a normal game, you may also do a lot of other things on this server because there's a plugin framework which allows you to extend the functionality of this server. Furthermore, you can even implement your own actions!
