# How to use
## New Version
**Event name may be different from Name above, see AbstractEvent**  
**The new version just adds register to the old version and supports asynchronous **
```java
public class Event implements AbstractEvent {
    @Override
    public void registerServerLoadEvent() {
        Log.clog("Example Plugin finished loading");
    }

    @Override
    public void registerPlayerJoinEvent(Player player) {
        player.sendSystemMessage("Hello!!! This is the new Event implementation for RW-HPS");
    }
}
````

## old version
``` java
Events.on(EventType.ServerLoadEvent.class, event -> {
    Log.clog("Example Plugin is finished loading");
});

Events.on(EventType.PlayerJoinEvent.class, event -> {
    event.getPlayer().sendSystemMessage("Plugin test This is the time of entry" + Time.getUtcMilliFormat(1));
});
```
